## Steps on building the assignment for SvelteKit & GraphQL & Houdini & Hasura

- Experimented some methods to use esbuild on a MacBookPro-mid2010 machine and found out **pnpm** with a **wasm-based esbuild** works well enough
- Needed to use enforce package.json into **nodeV-16** and **npmpV-8**
- Imported my icebreaker repo as a submodule, to test and export the data with  postgres-based RestAPI.
- Created a Hasura Cloud & Neon Console accounts. 
- Imported content for 3 tables from my **icebreaker** repo: users, contents and crossbindings.
- Started SvelteKit initial structure, imported some packages manually; FontAwesome, Tailwind, Flowbite for design-related needs
- Created a anonymous-accessible role for the GraphQL endpoints, enabling access to the tables
- Fetched the GraphQL-schema trough the watchSchema of the Hasura-config.
- Built up the component structure for various parts of the frontend
- Prepped the GraphQL queries first as +page.gql and then moved them to queries/ folder
- /user and /users pointing out to the stores auto-generated by the Houdini.
- tried to trigger the fetch manually, exchanged the fetch() with a detailed POST fetcher wtthin **lib/graphql/client**
- replaced role-based anon-access with the admin-key of Hasura
